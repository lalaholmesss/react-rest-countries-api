# React Rest Countries API 
This project is a solution to [Front-End Mentor Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca).
I used React + Vite, REST Countries API, Font-Awesome icons to build this project.

## Features 
- Displays country details such as population, region, and capital, as well as the country's flag.
- Filter functionality which helps the user to filter and display the countries depending on specific region.
- Light and dark theme switcher (work in progress).
- Search functionality to filter countries by name (work in progress).

  ## Upcoming Improvements
- Finalize Light/Dark Mode: Complete the implementation of the theme switcher.
- Improve Search Functionality.
- Country Details Page: Create a page for displaying more detailed information about each country.
- Responsive Design: Ensure the application looks great across all devices and screen sizes.
